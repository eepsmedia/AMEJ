## Statistical investigation

CODAP is a data analysis platform, 
so we expect it to help with statitical investigations.
One simple example won't do, however! 
School statistics covers a lot of ground,
ranging from making simple graphs and calculations in primary school
to doing statistical inference in high school and college. 

The first article in AMEJ focuses on Exploratory Data Analysis, or EDA.
This online page will let you explore that data in CODAP,
and see what it's like to use the tool yourself.

The live example below has the same data you saw in the article. 
Let's make a couple of the graphs from the article!

* Click the `Graph` icon on the toolbar to make a new, blank graph.
It will be filled with random points.

## The CODAP graphing principle
To make a sensible graph, you have to organize the points. 
To do that, do what we always ask students to do:
**label your axes**.
:::


* Label your axis by dragging a column heading to the horizontal axis in the graph.
Try dragging `Favourite physical activity`, which will be partly hidden.

* You cannot see all the activities! (You can see `OTHER` on the right edge.)
Stretch and move the graph and make it *wide*
so you can see all the categories. (It does not have to be tall.)

    awash.liveDemoAt(theURL);
</script>
:::

So many possibilities! It's hard to make sense of the graph. 
We made another column called simply `activity` that has only five possible choices.
Maybe that will be simpler.

* Drag `activity` to the horizontal axis, replacing `Favourite Physical Activity`.
* Now let's look at gender differences. 
Drag `Gender` into the _middle_ of the graph and drop it there. 
The points colour by gender.

You should see some gender differences in activity preference.
Do they make sense?

* For a different "look": drag `Gender` again, this time to the *vertical* axis.

### Graphing numeric data

Let's look at how students grow over time.

:::

* Use the fresh copy of our file, below.
* Make a new graph.
* Drag `Ageyears` to the horizontal axis and `Height` to the vertical axis. 
You should see a graph like the one at right.

It's clear that students are growing, but it doesn't look the same as the 
graph in the article. 
It's as if the points are hiding each other.
How did we do make, basically, a bunch of parallel dot plots? 

* Click on `Ageyears` to make a menu appear. 
* At the bottom of the menu, choose `Treat as Categorical`.


::: {.column-page-right}
<script>
    theURL2 = "https://codap.concord.org/releases/latest/static/dg/en/cert/index.html#shared=https%3A%2F%2Fcfm-shared.concord.org%2FBHH2QUqcB7qaN0TOmRao%2Ffile.json";
    awash.liveDemoAt(theURL2);
</script>
:::

When you do that, it's as if you're treating each age as a separate group,
and it plots in a separate plot.
Let's add more features to the graph, as we did in the article.

* Go to the ruler "palette" at the right of the graph and 
under `Measures of Center`, click `Mean` to make the mean values appear.

The mean height is clearly increasing---at least from ages 10 to 15. 
Why do you suppose it's _not_ increasing at the ends of the graph's range?

Perhaps there are not enough points to find a "stable" mean. 
We don't want to delete data! 
But for clarity, let's _hide_ those troublesome points.

* Select all the points below 10 years old, and click on the "eyeball" palette on the right.
* Choose `Hide Selected Cases`.
* Do the same for the 16--18-year-olds.

How do we add box plots? 

::: {.column-margin}
![](art/stats-height-age-box.png){width="100%"}
:::


* Return to the ruler palette, and under `Box Plot and Normal Curve`,
check the `Box Plot` item. 
* To get rid of the points, go to the paintbrush and make the point size go to zero.


* Investigate other relationships by making other graphs,
for example, `Height` against `ArmSpan`^[...which creates an opportunity for modelling with a function!].

All of that lives in the realm of exploratory data analysis.

Of course, there is a great deal more you can do with CODAP in EDA! 
You can find answers to many questions using the help system;
you can also read more and see more online lessons
in the (free) book, [Awash in Data](https://concord.org/awashindata).


A takeaway, we hope, is that CODAP gives you a tool and an environment
that can serve students from the very first bit of EDA 
all the way through formal inference.
