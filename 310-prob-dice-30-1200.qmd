### Rolling dice, 30 or 1200 times

This page lets you play with the CODAP file
we used to create the first examples in the paper.
The first table is set up to roll dice 30 times;
the second one rolls 1200 times. 

[Back to the main probability page](300-probability.qmd)

Here are things to do and play with:

* Click on a table and then on the "ruler" menu that appears on the right.
Choose **Rerandomize all**. 
That will re-roll the dice and, of course, re-plot the graphs.
Notice how the "30" graphs change a lot more than the "1200" graphs.

* Make graphs of the `sum` of the dice. 
Do you get the triangular shape you're "supposed to" get?

* Look at an 
[old blog post](https://bestcase.wordpress.com/2011/01/08/an-empirical-approach-to-dice-probability/) 
of mine that describes a lesson
about the sum of two dice.
That was in the days when we used Fathom.
Do the activities using this page in CODAP!
