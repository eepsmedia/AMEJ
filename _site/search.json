    "text": "In the article in the AMEJ, we gave an example looking at pulse data from students and teachers. We used a way cool technique called a randomization test in which we scrambled data values to make the null hypothesis true.\nWe’ll let you work with that data in a bit, and reproduce what we did in the journal. But first, let’s walk a slightly different path with similar data.\nWe’ll begin just doing more exploratory data analysis (EDA).\nSuppose we’re interested in gender differences in height, and remember that at about ages 10–12, girls are generally taller than boys.\nIs that really true?\nWe collect data on some ten-year-olds and plot the results, as you can see in the graph in the live example below. The blue lines are the mean heights of the groups; you can “hover” over the lines to see the values.\nWe have also calculated the difference of means in the left-hand column, diffMean: in this sample, the mean height for the girls is 3.66 cm greater than the mean height for boys.\n\n\n\nOf course, your students could make that graph themselves, and maybe draw the obvious conclusion: we were right, at age 10, girls are taller. And we should admit that, with 51 cases, making the graph and doing the calculation by hand would be tedious and error-prone.\nBut what else can students get out of using CODAP for this task? Here are some simple ideas:\n\n\n\n\nIf the data are from their own school, they can find themselves (or the memory of themselves) in the graph.\nThey can go to the ruler palette and make box plots, and compare those to the means1.\nThey can see and explore the overlap in the distributions and learn to interpret that overlap, for example, that despite the trend, there are a lot of short girls and tall boys.\nThey can investigate other relationships by making other graphs, for example, Height against UpperArm2.\n\nAll of that lives in the realm of exploratory data analysis.\nMore advanced students can explore whether the difference we see could plausibly be due to chance. Although we could do a formal \\(t\\)-test…\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA formal \\(t\\)-test (click to expand)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n…many stats educators are turning instead to randomization-based inference."

Does it occur very often among scrambled datasets? Our graph of 10 scrambles, above, doesn’t show any cases that extreme—but we only have ten!\nHere’s what ours looked like after 400 scrambles; we have also gone to the ruler palette to add two movable values and to ask CODAP to show the counts and percentages:\n\n\n\nresults from 400 scrambles.\n\n\nNow we need to decide: is this a one-tailed or two-tailed situation?

The list goes on.\n\n\n\nRight now, let’s look at another kind of model central to school mathematics: using a mathematical function to approximate data from some phenomenon.\nHere’s what we do:\n\nReach into a container of glass beads and pull out a few, up to about 20.\nCount the beads and record the number.\nPut the beads in a bowl and weigh them.1\nEnter the count and the mass into a CODAP table.\nPut the beads back into the container and repeat.\n\nThen, of course, we will plot the data (what goes on the horizontal axis??) and try to find a function that fits the data.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe ruler palette is attached to the graph.\n\n\nYou already know how to make a graph. To make a line, go to the ruler palette of the graph and choose Movable Line. Drag its handles to approximate the data. Notice how the slope-intercept form of the line appears and updates as you drag.\n\n\n\nA situation like this leads to some great questions such as:\n\nSuppose we put 100 beads in the bowl. What would the mass be?\nSuppose the bowl with the beads had a mass of 1 kg. How many beads would that be?\nIn the formula you got, what number is the slope?\nWhat does that slope mean?\nSame for the intercept…\n\nThese lead to more subtle and statistical questions…\n\n\n\n\n\nOne possible line\n\n\n\nWhy don’t the points line up perfectly?\nRemember that number you got for 1 kg of beads? How precise is that? What range of numbers do you think you would typically get?\nLooking at the formula in the figure, do you think it’s possible that the true formula is mass = 2 * count + 100?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNeed more screen space?\n\n\n\nWorking inside this site can be constraining.

That ruler palette has a Plotted Function option, and you can use sliders (from the toolbar) to make variable parameters.\nData sources. Here we used measurement data, which has built-in variability. That’s great, but it’s not the only way. Imagine one of those pattern problems where you count squares or triangles or dots. You could enter those numbers as data and plot them to find the (in this case, quadratic) function:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA quadratic model using the Plotted Function feature\n\n\nBest fit. The ruler palette will let you make a least-squares line. Before you do that, however consider: the least-squares line is not all that much better than what students will come up with using the movable line. Furthermore, think of what students might gain by moving those handles and seeing the formula change."

It’s also true that “computational thinking” does not require digital technologies.\nThat said, however, v9.0 does have a decided tilt towards the digital in order to prepare students for a world where that digital technology is so important. The same can be said for data, as implied in the introduction.\nWe also mentioned there that our big topics overlap. So the probability page with its roulette example also addresses computational thinking through the “models and simulation” channel. If a student created such a simulation om their own in order to answer the questions we had on that page, we would be thrilled, and it would be clear evidence of that student’s computational thinking.\nThus you have already seen at least one example. Let’s make another one, an example redolent with digital technology and algorithmic thinking.\nLet’s have students code.\n\n\nYes!\nThere is a plugin, simmer, that lets students use block programming techniques (similar to Scratch) to create probability simulations.\nIn the live example below, press the green “play” triangle to run the program. The program “emits” a data value into a CODAP table. Run it again to get more data. Make a graph of die1. Make sure you see how the program works, and why it’s a simulation of rolling a regular 6-sided die.\nExperiment with the blocks you have and the ones hidden in the toolbox on the left. Change the program so that it…\n\nRepeats 50 times with a single click.\nCreates data for two six-sided dice. Collect data and make a convincing graph that seven is the most likey sum.\nCreates a distribution of random values from the sum of two dice, but where the average value of the sum is zero."

Let’s see who lived through the disaster…\n\nDrag survived over the graph and “plop” it in the middle.\n\nThe points color by who survived.\n\n\n\nIt should be clear that, in general, females had a better chance of surviving.\nQuestions should emerge of the form, “how do I…?” or “Can I…?”, for example,\n\n\n\n\n\nDots fused into bars!\n\n\n\nCan I see counts and percentages?1\nHow do I make bar graphs out of those dots?2\nHow do I put my own data into CODAP?3\nCan I get this file just in a browser, not on this website?4\n\nFurther questions are for another time and place. For now, CODAP has online help (there is a button in the upper right), and that’s a good place to start.\nI hope that your imagination is already leaping ahead, thinking about what else this short experience makes possible, noting that it’s now easy for students to make graphs with over 1300 points and see patterns in the data.\nMore importantly, think about what other questions students can address as they explore, and what other ways you might connect mathematics through data. The side headings on the left lead you to some brief ideas.\n\n\nI am trying, in this site, not to overwhelm you with background. My philosophy is to help you acyually do things as soon as possible. As a result, you will have questions that don’t get answered. Here are some of them…\n\nWho makes CODAP?\n\nThe Concord Consortium. They develop great materials, mostly in maths and science. They are located in Concord, Massachusetts in the USA, and have a satellite office in California. On their site, they also have a home page for CODAP that links to good resources.\n\nIs it really free?\n\nYes. There is not even a way to add on something that costs money. All of the plugins are open-source and free.\n\nHow many data points can CODAP handle?\n\nThere is no set limit, but for most practical purposes, in 2023, five thousand cases is a reasonable limit. The elves at Concord are working to improve CODAP (“version 3”), and that will probably increase that limit…but they do not tell anyone when that’s likely to happen.\n\nI remember Fathom, Is CODAP like that?\n\nYes. CODAP is Fathom’s granddaughter, and therefore also related to TinkerPlots.\n\nHow do I rescale axes?\n\nDrag the numbers on the axes themselves, you’ll figure it out. But more importantly, learn any basic CODAP skill by using the Help system.\n\nWhere else can I learn more?\n\nTooting my own horn, I suggest Awash in Data. I used it with US high school students as an introduction to data science. It also includes a lot of information on CODAP features, including how to do teacherly things such as setting up documents for students to use."

School statistics covers a lot of ground, ranging from making simple graphs and calculations in primary school to doing statistical inference in high school and college.\nThe first article in AMEJ focuses on Exploratory Data Analysis, or EDA. This online page will let you explore that data in CODAP, and see what it’s like to use the tool yourself.\nThe live example below has the same data you saw in the article. Let’s make a couple of the graphs from the article!\n\nClick the Graph icon on the toolbar to make a new, blank graph. It will be filled with random points.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe CODAP graphing principle\n\n\n\nTo make a sensible graph, you have to organize the points. To do that, do what we always ask students to do: label your axes.\n\n\n\nLabel your axis by dragging a column heading to the horizontal axis in the graph. Try dragging Favourite physical activity, which will be partly hidden.\nYou cannot see all the activities! (You can see OTHER on the right edge.) Stretch and move the graph and make it wide so you can see all the categories. (It does not have to be tall.)\n\n\n\n\nSo many possibilities! It’s hard to make sense of the graph. We made another column called simply activity that has only five possible choices. Maybe that will be simpler.\n\nDrag activity to the horizontal axis, replacing Favourite Physical Activity.\nNow let’s look at gender differences. Drag Gender into the middle of the graph and drop it there. The points colour by gender.\n\nYou should see some gender differences in activity preference. Do they make sense?\n\nFor a different “look”: drag Gender again, this time to the vertical axis.\n\n\n\nLet’s look at how students grow over time.\n\n\n\n\nUse the fresh copy of our file, below.\nMake a new graph.\nDrag Ageyears to the horizontal axis and Height to the vertical axis. You should see a graph like the one at right.\n\nIt’s clear that students are growing, but it doesn’t look the same as the graph in the article. It’s as if the points are hiding each other. How did we do make, basically, a bunch of parallel dot plots?\n\nClick on Ageyears to make a menu appear.\nAt the bottom of the menu, choose Treat as Categorical.\n\n\n\n\nWhen you do that, it’s as if you’re treating each age as a separate group, and it plots in a separate plot. Let’s add more features to the graph, as we did in the article.\n\nGo to the ruler “palette” at the right of the graph and under Measures of Center, click Mean to make the mean values appear.\n\nThe mean height is clearly increasing—at least from ages 10 to 15. Why do you suppose it’s not increasing at the ends of the graph’s range?\nPerhaps there are not enough points to find a “stable” mean. We don’t want to delete data! But for clarity, let’s hide those troublesome points.\n\nSelect all the points below 10 years old, and click on the “eyeball” palette on the right.\nChoose Hide Selected Cases.\nDo the same for the 16–18-year-olds.\n\nHow do we add box plots?\n\n\n\n\nReturn to the ruler palette, and under Box Plot and Normal Curve, check the Box Plot item.\nTo get rid of the points, go to the paintbrush and make the point size go to zero.\nInvestigate other relationships by making other graphs, for example, Height against ArmSpan1.\n\nAll of that lives in the realm of exploratory data analysis.\nOf course, there is a great deal more you can do with CODAP in EDA! You can find answers to many questions using the help system; you can also read more and see more online lessons in the (free) book, Awash in Data.\nA takeaway, we hope, is that CODAP gives you a tool and an environment that can serve students from the very first bit of EDA all the way through formal inference."

Instead, we’re starting with comma-separated text, like you would find in a csv file. Let’s learn how to get that data into CODAP.\n\nSelect the text in the box and copy it.\nClick on the Tables icon in the toolbar. A menu appears. Choose -- new from clipboard --\n\nHooray! You have a CODAP table! It should have 48 cases.\n\n\n\nLet’s make the first graph from the article:\n\nClick Graph in the toolbar. A graph appears with random points.\nFrom the table, drag role to the horizontal axis and pulse to the vertical.\nNow, in the graph, click the ruler icon and choose mean (it’s unser Measures of Center)\nHover over the blue lines to see the values of the mean. Estimate the difference between the teachers and the students.\n\nSo far, we’re just exploring, and we’ve discovered an effect that we’re interested in: that teacher pulses seem to be systematically different from student pulses. You can make any number of interesting graphs using these data, but we will stick with the effect of role on pulse.\nThe next step in our process is to define a measure. This is a single number that describes the effect. In our case, that difference in mean pulse is perfect, so instead of just estimating it, we’ll calculate it.\n\n\n\n\nClick on the table and find the gray circle with the plus sign.\nClick that to make a new attribute (column). Name it diffPulse.\nClick on that new heading (diffPulse) to get its menu. Choose Edit Formula.... The formula box appears.\nEnter this formula. It’s long, but you can use copy and paste to make it easier to enter.\n\n\n\nClick Apply.\n\nMake sure you understand what we’re calculating with the formula. You should see a whole column filled with 5.8.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nWe’ll start this phase of the lesson with a fresh live example document (below), so if you had any trouble before, you can start here and be caught up!\n\n\nNow we want to do the scrambling.\n\nChoose scrambler from the Plugins menu. You should see an error message like the one below:\n\n\nIt says we need a measure. But we just made one: diffPulse!\n\n\n\nThe problem is, the scrambler doesn’t know that diffPulse is the measure. We need to “promote” it in the hierarchy by moving it left in the table.\n\nDrag diffPulse all the way to the left in the table and drop it in the blank white area you see there. It will turn yellow when it’s close.\n\n\n\n\nThe table will look like the one in the illustration, and the error message will change as shown.\n\nThe plugin wants to know what to scramble. Drag role over the scrambler and drop it there. Now the scrambler says, OK to scramble, which is what we want.\nPress the 1x button to perform the scrambling once. A new table appears with the results of that scramble. It’s called measures_from_clipboard data.\n\nThat table shows only the measure—the scrambled diffPulse—not the individual, scrambled cases.\n\nTo see those, press the show scrambled button. Another table appears (scrambled_clipboard data), just like the original table except with role scrambled. Look at that table to verify this.\nMake a new graph, just like the one you already have, except of the scrambled data. Be sure it makes sense to you.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nAt this point, you are running out of screen space! You can collapse objects by clicking on the big minus signs, upper right, next to the X’s that close the objects.\n\n\n\nChange the number in the scrambler box to 39. Watch the graph as you press 39x. See the points and means jump around. Observe: how much do they vary?\nMake yet another new graph, and put diffPulse from the measures collection on the horizontal axis.\nKeep adding cases until you get to 400.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nOrdinarily, you would put away the scrambled table and graph to save time during the scrambling.\n\n\n\n\n\nYou should see a big bell-shaped pile of points in your measures graph (like in the fresh live example below). These are the values of diffPulse that naturally arise just from the randomness in the scrambling process—a process in which the teachers and students have the same distribution of pulses, that is, there is no association between role and pulse.\n\n\n\nOur true value, the test statitsic, however, is 5.8. Where is that in the graph?\n\nClick on the measures graph to select it.\nThen, in the ruler palette, look under Plotted and Movable Values. Click Add Movable Value.\nMove the value to 5.8, or as close as you can get.\nAgain in the ruler palette, check Count and Percent. It will look something like the illustration.\n\n\nThe graph shows that 12% of the time, even if there were no systematic relationship, you’d still get a value of 5.8 or greater. Qualitatively, we see that a value of 5.8 just isn’t very special. Now, if we had a real difference of 15 bpm, we’d be ready to say, “if there were no relationship, then this value would be really unusual; so we’re confident that what we’re seeing is not just due to chance.”\nIn traditional statistical terms, that 12% is the p-value: 0.12. This is larger (i.e., less special, less significant) that the traditional (and these days suspect) value of 0.05."

Let’s look at another kind of model, a simulation that includes randomness.\nWe will model a process, in this case, the experience of playing roulette. To simplify things, we will always bet $1 on red. If red comes up, we get our $1 back plus $1 more. If it does not come up, we lose our $1.\n\n\n\nNow: on our roulette wheel, there are 38 slots, of which 18—less than half—are red. So even before we simulate, we admit that the “house” has an advantage. We could even compute the expected value of a single play, which will be less than zero.\nBut the expected value is not our question today. We want to know our chances of coming out ahead if we play 50 times. To figure that out theoretically is a bit more complicated than we want to tackle, so we’ll use the computer to play the game many times and record the results.\nWe will use a CODAP “plugin” called the Binomial Simulator. When you first load it, it looks like the one in the live example below. As you can see, it’s set up to do a coin experiment.\nThe cool thing in this plugin is that it’s all about the language. We will change the words (and some of the numbers) so that the paragraph at the top reads the way we want it. The we will press Engage! and CODAP will run the simulation.\nThe paragraph we want is this:\n\n\n\n\n\nChange the text and numbers in the simulator so that your paragraph matches that one.\nThen press Engage!. A CODAP table will appear with the number of red and the number of not red for each of the 100 sessions you simulated.\n\n\n\nWe want to know how much we won. That is the quantity red - not red. Let’s make a new column to calculate it.\nIn the upper right of the table, there is a gray circle with a plus sign. Click that to make a new column.\n\n\n\nFirst, you’ll give it a name; let’s call it net.\nThen click on the (underlined) name net to get a menu. Choose Edit Formula.\nIn the box, type red and a minus sign and then start typing not. CODAP will give you “not red” as an option; take it. You’ll see that (because of the space) CODAP surrounds the name 'not red' with ticks.\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter you click Apply, the net column fills with numbers: the net winnings during each session.\nGraph net. How many times (out of 100) is your value for net greater than zero?\nI don’t want to count them either. Here’s what to do:\n\nIn the ruler palette, click Movable Value and choose Add. A line appears that you can move back and forth.\nNow go back to the ruler palette and choose Count. Aha! Now you can see how many are on each side of the line. Position it just above zero to get the answer. We had 35 winners out of 100 sessions:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOf course, different students will get different results, but two things should be clear:\n\nIf we imagine that this represents 100 gamblers, fewer than half of them come out ahead.\nBy the same token, quite a few of them do. And they will be the ones that tell their friends how great it was to go gambling.\n\n\n\n\nEven Results. All values of net are even. Why?\nWhy Binomial? We’re using the Binomial Simulator because this particular situation is in fact binomial: the probability of winning each spin (18/38) is constant, and is independent of the success or failure of any other spin of the wheel.\nPlenty of other problems are not binomial (for example, the probability of drawing three aces in five cards) and they require different simulation tools.\nA lot of problems are binomial, though, so using this Binomial Simulator gives you an interesting, relatively simple entry into simulation. Want to see other binomial problems? Check out this chapter in the online book, Awash in Data.\nExpected Value. The expected value for one spin will be\n\\[E = \\frac{18}{38} - \\frac{20}{38} \\approx -0.053\\]\nThat is, on average, you lose five cents on every spin of the wheel.\nThis also means that the expected value for 50 spins is about –2.6. That should also be (roughly) the mean of your distribution for net—and it should get closer if you increase the sample size.\nThat said, your graph should show clearly that not very many players lose exactly $2.00. That is, you shouldn’t expect the expected value. This is an important statistical lesson about variability!\nPsychology of Gambling. It’s an interesting question whether we in school should avoid problems that involve gambling. One strategy is to do what we do here: present information that might help serve to inoculate students.\nIn a more sophisticated simulation, students could ask, what fraction of all players were ever ahead during their 50 spins? That turns out to be more than half, which might lead even more people to have a positive, “I almost won” feeling about their trip to the casino.\nBut of course, the house always comes out ahead."
