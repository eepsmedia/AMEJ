## But first, the basic basics. 

We have created a live example below. 
In it, you can use CODAP right on this page.

Scroll down and look. 
The document has a table in it 
with data about the 1309 passengers aboard the HMS _Titanic_.
Suppose we wanted to investigate whether
males or females were more likely to have survived.

Let's make a graph and see.

::: {.column-margin}
![The CODAP graph tool](art/graph-icon.png){width="60%"}
:::

* Click the `Graph` tool on the toolbar.

A graph appears. The points are randomly distributed.
We'll organize them by doing what we always tell students:
"label your axes."
In this case, the "label" is the column _heading_.

* Drag the column heading `gender` to the horizontal axis of the graph.

The points organize themselves into two columns, 
one for males, one for females.
Let's see who lived through the disaster...

* Drag `survived` over the graph and "plop" it in the middle.

The points color by who survived. 

::: {.column-page-right}

    awash.liveDemoAt(theURL);
</script>
:::

It should be clear that, in general, females
had a better chance of surviving.

Questions should emerge of the form, "how do I...?" or "Can I...?", for example,

::: {.column-margin}
![Dots fused into bars!](art/titanic-fused.png)
:::

* Can I see counts and percentages?^[Sure. Look in the "ruler" palette on the right of the graph.]
* How do I make bar graphs out of those dots?^[Check out the "configuration" palette; it's the one below the ruler. Choose "fuse dots into bars."]
* How do I put my own data into CODAP?^[Many ways. One is to drag a `csv` file into a document. It turns into a CODAP table.]
* Can I get this file just in a browser, not on this website?^[You bet!

Further questions are for another time and place. 
For now, CODAP has online help (there is a button in the upper right), and that's a good place to start.

I hope that your imagination is already leaping ahead,
thinking about what _else_ this short experience makes possible,
noting that it's now _easy_ for students to make graphs
with over 1300 points and see patterns in the data. 

More importantly, think about what other questions 
students can address as they explore,
and what other ways you might connect mathematics through data.
The side headings on the left lead you to some brief ideas.
